/* ============  CUSTOM.SCSS: ADD HERE YOUR OWN PROJECT'S  SCSS OR plain CSS CODE. ============ 
/* ============  THEN, DONT' FORGET TO RECOMPILE IN ORDER TO REBUILD YOUR CSS BUNDLE. ============ 

HOW DOES IT WORK?

    Edit this file, add your CSS/SCSS, save.
    View the page in your browser, 
    while logged in as administrator.
    Click the "SASS" symbol on the WP admin bar
    on the page top.
    
    Compiling will start and a window will be shown.

    The /sass/main.scss file will be compiled,
    and the Theme will serve it as a static 
    bundle.css file.
    By the way, the file name is customizable as well.

REGARDING THIS FILE: 

    CODE HERE YOUR MASTERPIECE, but before that, if you haven't yet,
    please take your time to understand and study how Bootstrap works.
    Many times you DON'T NEED to write custom CSS.
    Try using Bootstrap classes first.
    It can save you a lot of time,
    eg. to standardize project colors, or fully customize typography.
    First of all, have a ride in the WordPress Customizer.
    Set your project variables,
    So that simple classes like text-primary or bg-primary will refer to your brand color.
    Take your time to learn to use Bootstrap 5 classes and utility classes especially.
    
    https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/utilities/background/

    To explore things further, please note that picostrap actually implements also NinjaBootstrap,
    a small set of SCSS files that supercharges Bootstrap, mostly using it's own Utilities API, or custom SASS
    scripts, to create some more utility classes.
    We built NinjaBootstrap with the aim of giving to the developer a rich suitcase of reliable tools,
    that go beyond the basic Boostrap, enriched with some ideas inspired by what Tailwind offers.

    One example: sass/ninjabootstrap/_theme_colors_shades.scss
    This file generates additional classes to have lighter and darker variations of each of your theme colors.

    // UTILITY CLASSES TO SET TEXT COLOR:
    // (enabled by default)
    // text-primary-100 ... text-primary-900
    //
    // UTILITY CLASSES  TO SET BACKGROUND COLOR:
    // (enabled by default)
    // bg-primary-100 ... bg-primary-900
    // 
    // UTILITY CLASSES  TO SET BACKGROUND COLOR AND TEXT COLOR ACCORDINGLY:
    // (available ONLY  if you flag the "Enable Text Bg Shades" option in the Customizer Color panel) 
    // text-bg-primary-100 ... // text-bg-primary-900

IMPORTANT NOTE REGARDING PATHS FOR REFERENCING ELEMENTS IN THE THEME FOLDER
    
    Please prepend ../ in the path, as the rendered CSS
    that is executed from the browser is in the /css-output/ theme subfolder
